## *What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?*
This milestone project is to demonstrate my knowdlge and skills aquired in the Backend Development module. The main modules include Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development. Then put all the concepts together to create a fully responsive CRUD web application. This Application will allow a user to create, read, update and delete relevant data when interacting with the Job Zone Application.

### *Functionality of the project*
This application demonstrate the key CRUD requirement functionality, uses a data handling document based database, MongoDB. The user functionality is created using Flask, HTML templates and CSS. A modern front-end framework called Materializecss (similar to Bootsrap) was used in building a beautiful and responsive frontend interface, to promote ease of use and intuition when interacting with app.

The application has a Registration and Login system to show clear seperation between documents created by each Registered user. These functions utilise creating, updating and reading to the database along with password hashing to protect each individuals credentials.The user has to be registered if they want to use the site.

## *User Experience*

### Project goals
The goal is to help both organizations and job seekers to connect and grow together. To help
 employers speed up their hiring process. It would be easier for hiring managers to check job applications online than manually scan printed resumes. The site give employers access to a list of candidates with the required skills, achievements, and experience to select from. This helps them save time, effort and is cost effective for both the employer and jobseekers.

#### *Typography*
The project uses Open Sans font on its own through out the site. "Montserrat" is used as a fallback font, in cases where Open Sans for some reasons fails to load. This means Montserrat will load in order to back up the failed font. I like the Open Sans font as I find it elegant, sophisticated, yet modern. It is beautifully legible and offers an excllenexcellent reading experience.
