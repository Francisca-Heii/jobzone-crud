## *What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?*
This milestone project is to demonstrate my knowdlge and skills aquired in the Backend Development module. The main modules include Python Fundamentals, Practical Python and Data Centric Development. Then put all the concepts together to create a fully responsive CRUD web application. This Application will allow a user to create, read, update and delete relevant data when interacting with the Job Zone Application.

### *Functionality of the project*
This application demonstrate the key CRUD requirement functionality, uses a data handling document based database, MongoDB. The user functionality is created using Flask, HTML templates and CSS. A modern front-end framework called Materializecss (similar to Bootsrap) was used in building a beautiful and responsive frontend interface, to promote ease of use and intuition when interacting with app.

The application has a Registration and Login system to show clear seperation between documents created by each Registered user. These functions utilise creating, updating and reading to the database along with password hashing to protect each individuals credentials.The user has to be registered if they want to use the site.

## *User Experience*

### Project goals
The goal is to help both organizations and job seekers to connect and grow together. To help
 employers speed up their hiring process. It would be easier for hiring managers to check job applications online than manually scan printed resumes. The site give employers access to a list of candidates with the required skills, achievements, and experience to select from. This helps them save time, effort and is cost effective for both the employer and jobseekers.

* [Ipad]
* [Desktop](wireframes/wireframes_desktop.pdf)

### *DESIGN*
* I decided to keep the design of the application minimalistic and clean.
* Each page contains relevant contenet to communicate to the user rather than to overwhelm them with unneccessary information.
* Links and buttons have a hover effect.
* I decided to use cards and tables to keep information clear and easy to read
* Used a background color to add a pop on firing flash messages

#### *Color Scheme*
* The colors used throughout the website are:

RGB (0,64,153): This dark blue color is used on the navigation bar and the icons used on profile pages has a blue with a gradient  dark blue background on menu items.

RGB (9,148,218): This greenish color is used as a background color for the buttons, it has a very light green color on hoovering the button. 

#F5F5F5: This whitesmoke color is used as a background  color of the body. 
 
A #b3e5fc is applied on flash messages.
  
A grey color is used on the table for search jobs to make the the jo search stand out.

#### *Typography* 
 The main font used is <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?category=Sans+Serif">Open Sans</a>. I decided to use this font in the entire application due to its elegant, sophisticated, yet modern. It is beautifully legible and offers an excellent reading experience, which I thought it would be a perfect font for a job portal app.

<a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat?category=Sans+Serif">Montserrat</a> is used as a fallback font, in cases where Open Sans for some reasons have difficulty loading or fails to load altogether, This is where Montserrat takes over and load in the browser to back up the failed font.
 
### *Imagery*
* The banner image on landing page is from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/hot-air-balloon-photo-597054/">Pixels</a>
* Icons are from <a href="https://fontawesome.com/v4.7/icons/">Font Awesome</a>
